        <h2>Nutrition</h2>
<p>Nutrition is a critical part of health and development. Better nutrition is related to improved infant, child, and maternal health, stronger immune systems, safer pregnancy and childbirth, lower risk of non-communicable diseases (such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease), and longevity. To maintain a balanced diet, aim to include the following in your daily meals:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fruits and Vegetables:</strong> Consume at least 400 g (about five portions) of fruits and vegetables per day, excluding potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava, and other starchy roots. Fruits and vegetables provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber that support overall health.</li>

    <li><strong>Legumes:</strong> Include legumes such as lentils and beans, which are excellent sources of plant-based protein, fiber, and other important nutrients that support heart health and digestion.</li>

    <li><strong>Nuts and Whole Grains:</strong> Incorporate nuts and whole grains like unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat, and brown rice. Whole grains provide fiber, vitamins, and minerals, while nuts offer healthy fats and proteins that help with sustained energy and heart health.</li>

    <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Drink at least 8 glasses of water a day. Hydration is key for maintaining healthy bodily functions, including digestion, metabolism, and temperature regulation.</li>
</ul>

        <h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>Physical activity plays a vital role in promoting overall well-being, enhancing both physical and mental health. Here are some updated tips for incorporating exercise into your lifestyle:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Aim for at least 30 minutes of movement daily:</strong> This can include any form of activity like brisk walking, jogging, dancing, or playing a sport. Consistency is more important than intensity, so find activities that you enjoy.</li>

    <li><strong>Mix up aerobic and anaerobic exercises:</strong> Aerobic exercises, such as cycling, swimming, or running, improve cardiovascular health, while anaerobic exercises like sprinting, weightlifting, or high-intensity interval training (HIIT) build muscle and strength.</li>

    <li><strong>Focus on core and functional movements:</strong> Core exercises like planks, leg raises, and balance drills can strengthen your core muscles, improving posture and reducing back pain.</li>

    <li><strong>Prioritize recovery and stretching:</strong> Regular stretching, foam rolling, and low-impact activities like yoga or Pilates can help with muscle recovery, flexibility, and stress relief.</li>

    <li><strong>Incorporate movement throughout your day:</strong> Take frequent breaks to stretch or walk, stand up while working, or even incorporate short bursts of physical activity like squats or jumping jacks during downtime.</li>

        <h2>Mental Health</h2>
        <p>Mental well-being is as important as physical health. Stress, anxiety, and depression can all impact your overall health. Here's how to maintain good mental health:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Get restful sleep:</strong> Sleep isn’t just a nonnegotiable for physical health. It also plays an essential role in mental health.The quality of your sleep matters, too: Disrupted sleep can contribute to mental health symptoms.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Keep your phone in a drawer or outside your bedroom while sleeping to avoid distractions and improve sleep quality.</li>
        <li>Make a list of alternate, more meaningful activities to replace your usual scrolling sessions, such as reading, exercising, or spending time with family and friends.</li>
        <li>Turn off notifications or delete social apps from your phone to reduce temptation and free up mental space for other activities.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
        <li><strong>Strengthen your relationships:</strong> Humans are social creatures, and strong relationships can have a positive influence on your mental health in various ways.</li>
